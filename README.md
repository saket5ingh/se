Q2. a) Why Agile Development approach in most of the organizations results
into fractured development approach? Write your analysis with
examples. 3 Marks Question
ChatGPT
The Agile development approach in organizations can sometimes result in a fractured development approach due to several reasons:
1. **Lack of Proper Implementation:** Many organizations adopt Agile methodologies without fully understanding its principles or without
proper training for their teams. This can lead to fragmented implementation where teams may cherry-pick Agile practices or misinterpret
them, resulting in inconsistencies across projects.
 Example: In a software development company, one team decides to implement daily stand-up meetings as part of Agile practices, while
another team neglects this aspect. This inconsistency can lead to communication gaps and hinder collaboration.
2. **Overemphasis on Speed:** Agile is often associated with rapid delivery and flexibility, but this emphasis on speed can sometimes
compromise other important aspects such as quality and long-term planning. Teams may prioritize short-term goals over sustainable
development practices, leading to technical debt and reduced overall productivity.
 Example: A software team adopts Agile with a focus solely on delivering new features quickly without paying attention to code quality or
refactoring. As a result, they accumulate technical debt over time, making it increasingly difficult to maintain and enhance the software
in the long run.
3. **Fragmented Teams:** Agile methodologies encourage self-organizing teams and decentralized decision-making. However, in larger
organizations or complex projects, this decentralization can sometimes lead to fragmented teams with different interpretations of project
goals and priorities.
 Example: In a large software development project, different Agile teams may have conflicting priorities or divergent understandings of
user requirements. This can result in disjointed efforts and a lack of alignment towards common project objectives.
Overall, while Agile methodologies offer numerous benefits such as adaptability and customer collaboration, organizations must ensure
proper implementation and alignment across teams to avoid the pitfalls of fractured development approaches.
